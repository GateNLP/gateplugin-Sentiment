The following two papers should be cited:

Crowdsourcing a Word-Emotion Association Lexicon, Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney, Computational Intelligence, 29 (3), 436-465, 2013.

Emotions Evoked by Common Words and Phrases: Using Mechanical Turk to Create an Emotion Lexicon, Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney, In Proceedings of the NAACL-HLT 2010 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Analysis and Generation of Emotion in Text, June 2010, LA, California.

Note that we'll probably manually edit these as there are some really weird things in there.
e.g. "art", "dawn" and "expect" are all listed as "surprise".
